I have over a decade of experience in infrastructure engineering and backend development, working with cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP. My expertise includes deploying and managing software in cloud environments, with a strong focus on containerization, Kubernetes, and serverless technologies like AWS Lambda.

Automation is a key part of my approach, helping improve efficiency through well-designed CI/CD pipelines. In addition to infrastructure, I enjoy backend development and building scalable, reliable systems that enhance user experiences, and reduce costs.

I stay up to date with industry trends and enjoy tackling challenges at the intersection of infrastructure and backend engineering. Obviously, I am also keeping an eye in the AI and ML space, and I use some of these tools to help with my work.

Outside of work, physical fitness is important for me: I'm a purple belt Jiu-Jitsu practioner, but I also enjoy bouldering and running. I love spending time outdoors, away from cities, especially high up in the mountains.

I also enjoy learning new languages and am currently embarked in a journey to become fluent in Mandarin Chinese.
