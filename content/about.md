Boasting over a decade of expertise, I am a seasoned professional in both infrastructure engineering and backend development. I specialize in crafting and deploying software across cloud environments, with proficiency in AWS, Azure, and GCP.

My technical journey encompasses in-depth knowledge of containerization and Kubernetes, along with mastery of Functions as a Service (FaaS) systems like AWS Lambda. I prioritize automation as a catalyst for operational efficiency, with a keen focus on implementing comprehensive Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

Beyond infrastructure, I am eager to contribute my skills as a backend engineer. My passion for backend development stems from a commitment to creating robust, scalable solutions that power seamless user experiences. Whether orchestrating cloud resources or architecting backend systems, I bring a holistic approach to technology challenges.

Thriving in the dynamic intersection of infrastructure and backend engineering, I stay at the forefront of industry trends to deliver innovative solutions. Let's collaborate to optimize your infrastructure, drive operational efficiency, and elevate your backend capabilities.
