    <p>I have over a decade of experience in infrastructure engineering and backend development, working with cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP. My expertise includes deploying and managing software in cloud environments, with a strong focus on containerization, Kubernetes, and serverless technologies like AWS Lambda.</p>
<p>Automation is a key part of my approach, helping improve efficiency through well-designed CI/CD pipelines. In addition to infrastructure, I enjoy backend development and building scalable, reliable systems that enhance user experiences, and reduce costs.</p>
<p>I stay up to date with industry trends and enjoy tackling challenges at the intersection of infrastructure and backend engineering. Obviously, I am also keeping an eye in the AI and ML space, and I use some of these tools to help with my work.</p>
<p>Outside of work, physical fitness is important for me: I&rsquo;m a purple belt Jiu-Jitsu practioner, but I also enjoy bouldering and running. I love spending time outdoors, away from cities, especially high up in the mountains.</p>
<p>I also enjoy learning new languages and am currently embarked in a journey to become fluent in Mandarin Chinese.</p>
